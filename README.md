### Hi, I’m Pranav 👋

I'm a Master's student in E-Government at Universität Koblenz and a passionate software developer who enjoys building thoughtful, user-focused products. 

- 💻 Currently exploring agentic workflows through iOS app development using Swift
- 🏆 Hackathon enthusiast — won 3rd place at a national-level blockchain hackathon in India
- 🌐 Comfortable navigating the full stack — from architecting stateful, responsive UIs in React/TypeScript to building and integrating scalable backend services in Typescript/Python
- 🧠 Always curious about product-market fit, distribution and shipping software that matters
